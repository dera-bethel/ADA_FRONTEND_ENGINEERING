    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsuem</h1>
    <img src="./images/lorem ipsum.png" alt="lorem photo" width="25%">
    <p>Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is a dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. </p>
    <p>The purpose of <i>lorem ipsum </i>is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that<br>
     doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without <u>controversy</u>, laying out pages with meaningless filler <br>
     text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.</p>
    <p>The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again<br>
    during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates,<br>
    websites, and stock designs. Use our <u>generator</u> to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.</p>
